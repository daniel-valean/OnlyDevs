## Description

* This webpage is a donation/funding site geared toward funding developers applications.
* Our motivation for this website is to establish a place for developers and startups to post the link to their application, a description of the application, and how donations would help them fulfill their vision.
* Our group designed this webpage to help understand how to work together on a group project through Github and further our knowledge on API calls.
* The webpage allows the user to sign up/log in and donate money to their preferred projects using stripe.
